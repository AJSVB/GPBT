# GPBT

'FSN' folder contains all experiments environment and data processing: 'FSN/final_notebook.ipynb' and 'FSN/Boston_analytics.ipynb' for boston. 'FSN/MNIST.ipynb' and 'FSN/MNIST_analytics.ipynb' for Mnist.'FSN/FMNIST.ipynb' and 'FSN/FMNIST_analytics.ipynb' for FMnist. Raw data from such experiments are in 'FSN/data_brut' folder, while treated outputs are in 'FSN/data_result' folder. 

'TO_GPU' is the folder for CIFAR that was sent to a GPU, run 'TO_GPU/dependencies.sh' to run GPBT experiment. There are files 'TO_GPU/bohb1.py', 'TO_GPU/pbt.py' for other models as well. 

'result_TO_GPU' is the folder with the outputs of the GPU computations, See FSN/CIFARanalytics.ipynb to see how the data processing related.
